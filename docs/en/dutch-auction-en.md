# Dutch Auction

> Dutch auctions are also called "reduced price auctions". A special type of auction. The bidding price of the auction target decreases from high to low until the first bidder responds (reaches or exceeds the reserve price) when the hammer strikes the auction. Reduced-price auctions usually start with very high prices, sometimes so high that no one bids. At this time, the price will decrease in a predetermined price reduction ladder, from high to low, until a bidder is willing to accept it.

This NFT ticket sales will also adopt this scheme. The current plan is:

From the beginning of the auction, the price will be adjusted every 30 minutes until the reserve price. 

**UPDATE**

We will adjust the price manually. If no one bids within five minutes, we will go directly to the next stage.
