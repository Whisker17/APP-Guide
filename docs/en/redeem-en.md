# Redeem 

In the [Concept](README.md) of the prediction market, the outcome token we purchased will eventually be settled into the original token, which is ZBS in our system, but this process is not automatic and requires us to redeem it manually.

1. When the market status is `Resolved`, we can redeem our tokens

3. After confirming the result, you can see a transaction option of `Redeem` on the right

   The red box in the lower right corner indicates the number of winning tokens you have, that is, the number of ZBS you can redeem

4. Sign the transaction and redeem your ZBS
