## What Is Prediction Market?

> Prediction market is a collection of beliefs of a group of people who speculate on future events or results. Including (but not limited to) elections, company sales strategies, commodity price fluctuations, even weather changes, and almost any event or result that can be objectively verified afterwards.

For example, Alice and Bob want to participate in the company's internal elections. We create a market that includes the outcome tokens for the victory of both parties. In the end, the value of the token of whoever wins is 1 and the value of the other party's token is 0. At first, the probability of two people winning is set to be the same (that is, the price of the two peopleâ€™s tokens in the prediction market is 0.5), but obviously this is unreasonable, because the two people cannot be exactly the same. One party must be more popular in the company and more likely to win. Assuming Alice's popularity and ability are better, then everyone will feel that the probability of Alice winning will be greater than 50%, and everyone will bet on Alice. At this time, the price of Alice's winning token may reach 0.9 and Bob's token price dropped to 0.1. At this time, Alice was exposed to a series of scandals. Everyone sold their Alice tokens and bought Bob tokens. In the end, Bob won, and everyone who had Bob tokens profited. If you buy Bob's token when the price of Bob's token is 0.1, for example, if you buy 10 Bob tokens for 1, you will eventually get 10.
